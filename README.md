# OLX  App

## This project aims to recreate some of the main features of olx.

The user can access the app from both android and ios.
When the user opens the app on the main screen, he sees the ads and can apply filters by region and category.
When filtering items it's possible to click and view details about that item, view photos, 
and press call to initiate a call to the seller.
The user can log in and log out of the app, if logged in he can view the ads he has published, 
and edit the ads, as add new ones.
When creating new ad the new ad registration screen appears,
it's possible to select the images from the device's gallery.
When creating an ad it contains mandatory fields and only creates if they are filled.
